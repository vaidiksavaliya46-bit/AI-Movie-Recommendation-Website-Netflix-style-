## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a keyword (like “action”, “comedy”, or “Nolan”).  
2. The program checks for matches across:
   - Movie title  
   - Genres  
   - Keywords  
   - Director name  
3. Each match increases the movie’s **match score**.  
4. The top 5 results are displayed dynamically as “AI Picks.”
